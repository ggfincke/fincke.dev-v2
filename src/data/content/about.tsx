    intro:   `I am a full-stack engineer passionate about building intuitive, 
              performant software with a strong emphasis on clean code and maintainable architecture. From web platforms and mobile apps to data pipelines and AI tools, 
              I specialize in crafting end-to-end solutions that scale through thoughtful design and best practices.`,
    
    journey: `My journey in software development began when I was introduced to Scratch in middle school. 
              I fell in love with it immediately and haven't stopped coding since! I continued to code in high school, 
              eventually choosing to go to Penn State where I developed the majority of my skills and knowledge in computer science 
              and software engineering, with a particular focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. Since then, I've been expanding my skills through both professional work and personal projects, always striving to follow best practices and produce high-quality software.`,
    
    personal: `Outside of coding, I find balance through various outlets, primarily swimming, running, and journaling. 
               Physical fitness is a big part of my life, and I find it helps me stay focused and balanced. I find it very satisfying
               to set big goals and work steadily toward them. In Summer 2024, I completed an Ironman 70.3, and lately I've been eyeing a 
               full marathon and/or open water swim races. Additionally, when I have the time, I like to produce music and play video games, 
               and when I have the money, I love to travel!`
