    "I'm a full-stack engineer who ships clean, maintainable systems end-to-end. I work mostly in Python and TypeScript, but I have experience across numerous languages. Most recently, I've been experimenting with Java/Go. Across the backend, I tend to lean on FastAPI/Django + Postgres with Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS for CI/CD and ops. On the frontend, I near-exclusively use React/Next.js for web. I've also used Swift and SwiftUI/UIkit extensively for mobile development.",
    "I'm big on consistency, whether that's in code or in training. I've completed an Ironman 70.3, and outside of work I'm usually building side projects, iterating on tools I use a lot, and making small improvements where I can.",
    "Outside of code, I swim, run, and journal. My workout consistency is the same I bring to my engineering approach–boring and effective. I completed an Ironman 70.3 in 2024 and I'm eyeing a full marathon and open-water races. When there's time, I produce music and play video games; when there's budget, I adore travel.",
